# Data Professionals Survey
## Introduction
Data as we know is a very important aspect in decision making for businesses, an essential material in the development of models which are used in the advancement of technology and solving problems. 
I take a look at the various professionals that make use of this data in its many different forms. Highlighting there various reasons for using data, thier favourite programming languages used, 
their motivation for choosing a career path in data technology and some of the countries with the most data professionals.
by analysing and visualising the survey data of Data Professionals conducted by Alex Freberg.

I aim to gain knowledge of the following through this analysis:
* The average salary made in respect to the job role.
* Respondents favourite programming language.
* The ratio of males to females who have a career as data professionals.
## Methodology

## Recommendations
People who are looking to break into or have a career in data technology should learn the Python programming language as it seems it is the most easy to use based on 
its popularity. Also, more females are encouraged to take up a career in data technology as there is enough room to accomodate everyone.
